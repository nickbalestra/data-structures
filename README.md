Data-Structures
==============

This is a project I completed as a student at Hack Reactor. This project was worked on with a pair. The project contains various type data-structures implemented in javascript relying on different instantiation patterns.

## Data structures:

- Queue
- Stack
- Set
- LinkedList
- Tree
- BinarySearchTree
- Graph
- HashTable


### Testing

Tests are made with the [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) testing framework.
Test are located in the ./spec directory. To run the tests, just open the spec runner file with a browser.
