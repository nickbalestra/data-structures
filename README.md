Data-Structures
==============

This is a project I worked on as a student at Hack Reactor. This project was worked on with a pair. The project implements in javascript the following data-structures.

## Data structures:

- Queue
- Stack
- Set
- LinkedList
- DoublyLinkedList
- Tree
- BinarySearchTree
- Graph
- HashTable
- PrefixTree (Trie)

**Some code may be written in ES6 and may require to be transpiled in order to be tested**.

### Requirements

ES6 enabled on chrome `chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony.`
Babeljs.io for transipiling.

### Testing

Tests are made with the [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) testing framework.
Test are located in the ./spec directory. To run the tests, just open the spec runner file with a browser.
